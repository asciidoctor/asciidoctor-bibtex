asciidoctor-bibtex adds bibtex integration to AsciiDoc documents by introducing two new macros: `cite:[KEY]` and `bibliography::[]`.
Citations are parsed and replaced with formatted inline texts, and reference lists are automatically generated and inserted into where `bibliography::[]` is placed. 

asciidoctor-bibtex is designed to be used as an extension to {url-asciidoctor}[Asciidoctor].
Thus this extension can be used together with other asciidoctor extensions such as {url-asciidoctor-mathematical}[asciidoctor-mathematical] and {url-asciidoctor-pdf}[asciidoctor-pdf] to enrich your AsciiDoc experience.

NOTE: asciidoctor-bibtex no longer supports AsciiDoc-to-AsciiDoc conversion.

== History

asciidoctor-bibtex starts as a fork of {url-asciidoc-bib}[asciidoc-bib] and goes along a different path.
The major reason for the fork at the time was the differences in citation and bibliography macros.
asciidoc-bib failed to follow the grammar of macros in AsciiDoc and thus caused problems with existing documents and extensions.
Thus, a fork was needed.
Another reason was the inability to pass configuration via AsciiDoc attributes.

While {url-asciidoc-bib}[asciidoc-bib] focuses on replacing citations in the original documents and produces new AsciiDoc documents, asciidoctor-bibtex focuses on compatibility with Asciidoctor and other Asciidoctor extensions at the very beginning.
As time passes, asciidoctor-bibtex diverges significantly from its ancesstor.
For example, asciidoctor-bibtex now supports generating real bibtex citations and bibliography, so it can be used together with {url-asciidoctor-latex}[asciidoctor-latex] for native bibtex support.

== Install

 $ gem install asciidoctor-bibtex

asciidoctor-bibtex depends on https://github.com/inukshuk/bibtex-ruby[bibtex-ruby], https://github.com/inukshuk/citeproc-ruby[citeproc-ruby], and https://github.com/inukshuk/csl-styles[csl-styles].
Ensure the `ruby-dev` and `libxslt1-dev` packages are installed on your machine so the dependencies will compile properly.

{url-asciidoctor}[Asciidoctor] must also be installed for 'asciidoctor-bibtex' to work.
Asciidoctor version 1.5.2 or higher is required.

== Usage

First, you need to have a valid bibtex file.
You specify the location to this file using the `bibtex-file` document attribute.

=== Macros

Syntax for inserting a citation is the following inline macro:

 cite|citenp:[ref(pages), ...]

where '(pages)' is optional.

Examples of "chicago-author-date" style:

* `cite:[Lane12]` becomes "(Lane 2012)"
* `citenp:[Lane12]` becomes "Lane (2012)"
* `cite:[Lane12(59)]` becomes "(Lane 2012, 59)"

For *apa* (Harvard-like) style:

* `cite:[Lane12]` becomes "(Lane, 2012)"
* `citenp:[Lane12]` becomes "Lane (2012)"
* `cite:[Lane12(59)]` becomes "(Lane, 2012, p.59)"

For *ieee*, a numeric style:

`cite:[Lane12,Lane11]` becomes "[1, 2]"

To add a list of formatted references, place `bibliography::[]` on a line by itself.

=== Configuration

Configuration is applied in the form of AsciiDoc document attributes, which must be defined in the document header.
